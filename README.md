# Retail-Demand-Forecasting-LSTM
This project uses LSTM neural networks to forecast monthly product demand for an online retailer using the "Online Retail II" dataset. It optimizes inventory management, reduces stockouts, and explores generative AI for personalized marketing and product design.
# Retail Demand Forecasting with LSTM

## Overview
This project aims to solve a crucial problem for online retail companies: accurately forecasting product demand. By leveraging the **"Online Retail II" dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this project develops a deep learning model to predict monthly product demand. Demand forecasting is a vital component of supply chain management, as it helps companies optimize inventory, reduce the costs associated with overstocking or stockouts, and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability.

The project utilizes a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network, which is particularly well-suited for handling time-series data like historical sales. The model is designed to learn from patterns in past sales data and make predictions about future demand for various products.

## Why Demand Forecasting?
Demand forecasting helps businesses predict customer demand, enabling them to:
- **Optimize Inventory**: Avoid overstocking or running out of stock, both of which can have serious financial implications.
- **Improve Procurement Planning**: Forecasts help procurement teams make data-driven decisions on how much stock to order.
- **Enhance Customer Satisfaction**: Ensures products are available when customers need them, which boosts overall satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Proper demand forecasting helps reduce costs associated with warehousing surplus goods and emergency procurement when stock runs out.

## Problem Definition & Dataset Preparation
The specific task in this project is **monthly demand forecasting** for products sold by a UK-based online retail company. The **"Online Retail II" dataset** contains records of customer transactions and includes information such as stock codes, quantities sold, invoice dates, and customer IDs. 

Key preprocessing steps undertaken for this project:
1. **Data Loading**: Merged multiple sheets from the provided dataset into a single dataframe for easy manipulation.
2. **Duplicate Removal**: Removed duplicate records to ensure data quality.
3. **Handling Cancellations**: Excluded canceled transactions (marked with 'C' in the invoice number) to focus on valid sales.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Removed records with non-positive quantities or prices, which likely represent returns or data entry errors.
5. **Date Formatting**: Converted the 'InvoiceDate' column into a proper datetime format for time-series analysis.
6. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing customer IDs were filled with placeholder values to retain those transactions. This ensures that aggregate demand isn’t underestimated due to missing data.
7. **Data Aggregation**: Created a new column combining the 'Year' and 'Month' from the invoice date, and then grouped data by 'Country' and 'StockCode' to aggregate total product sales by month.

## Model Development: LSTM for Time-Series Forecasting
The core of this project is the **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model, a type of recurrent neural network that is effective for learning sequences and long-term dependencies in data. In this case, LSTM is used to learn from historical sales data to predict future monthly demand.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Preparation for LSTM**: The data was structured into sequences of 12 months, where the model would learn from 12 consecutive months of sales data to predict the demand for the following month.
- **Training/Validation Split**: The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%). The training set was further split into 75% training and 25% validation data to monitor the model's generalization capability.
- **Model Architecture**: The LSTM network was built with layers designed to process the input sequence of monthly sales data. Key hyperparameters like the number of LSTM units, batch size, and learning rate were tuned during training.
- **Training Process**: The model was trained over 70 epochs, and its performance was evaluated using loss metrics. Both training and validation loss were tracked to ensure the model wasn’t overfitting and generalizes well to unseen data.

### Model Performance:
The performance of the model was monitored using both **training and validation loss**. The gap between these losses remained minimal, indicating that the model was learning well without overfitting to the training data. The model is now capable of predicting monthly demand based on 12 months of historical data, making it a valuable tool for inventory and procurement planning.

## Ethical Considerations
Building and deploying a demand forecasting model involves ethical considerations, particularly in ensuring fairness and transparency:
- **Fairness**: The model needs to fairly represent all products, including niche items that may not have high sales but are still crucial for certain customer segments.
- **Accountability**: Any significant discrepancies between the forecast and actual demand should be reported and investigated to continuously improve the model.
- **Transparency**: The decision-making process of the model should be explainable to stakeholders. Efforts should be made to ensure that non-technical stakeholders understand how the model works and its limitations.
